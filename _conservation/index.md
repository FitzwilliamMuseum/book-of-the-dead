As part of the project to conserve the papyrus containing the Book of the Dead of Ramose, Renée Waltham, a specialist papyrus conservator carried out the work of investigating, cleaning and consolidating the papyrus, as well as later mounting it for permanent storage and display. She also worked with Irmtraut Munro, an Egyptologist from the [Totenbuch-Projekt (Book of the Dead Project)](http://totenbuch.awk.nrw.de/projekt/das-totenbuch), who led the work of recognising how the papyrus fragments fitted together.
