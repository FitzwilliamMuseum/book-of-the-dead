Spell 105 _‘for providing for the ka-spirit of Ramose’_{:.text-danger} and Spell 95 _‘for being in the presence of Thoth’_{:.text-danger}, Book of the Dead of Ramose

An important of the work of restoring this papyrus was a detailed programme of examination and analysis of the materials used in the beautiful illustrations; for example the colours and how the gold leaf was applied.

The analyses were carried out with help from the [Department of Forensic Science and Chemistry at Anglia Ruskin University](https://aru.ac.uk/science-and-engineering/research/institutes-and-groups/forensic-and-investigative) and the [Hamilton Kerr Institute](https://www-hki.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/).

As a result of this work, we know much more about the painting materials that were used and also how the illustrations were created.
