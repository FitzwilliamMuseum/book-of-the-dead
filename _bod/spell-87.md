Vignette from Spell 87 of the  Book of the Dead of Ramose

Spell 87 is for &lsquo;being transformed into a son of the earth&rsquo;. This was a snake described as being &lsquo;long of years, who sleeps and is reborn every day&rsquo;. The Egyptians believed snakes were dangerous creatures to be both feared and revered. They had a protective role &mdash; for example the king was usually depicted with a cobra on his forehead, but they also had a destructive nature &mdash; the principal enemy of the sun-god was a huge snake called Apep or Apophis.

As in this papyrus, spell 87 is often found with spells 86 (for being transformed into a swallow) and 88 (for being transformed into a crocodile).
