Vignette from Spell 77 of the Book of the Dead of Ramose

Spells 77 enables Ramose to turn into a hawk of gold. The text tells us that his back is 7 cubits (about 3.7 meters) in length, with wings made of green stone and the head of a _benu-_bird (which can be seen in [spell 83](/explore/the-book-of-the-dead/spell-83)).

The picture for this spell shows a golden hawk-figure which is standing on a mat. It has a golden flail at its shoulder.

In Ramose's Book of the Dead, as in many other examples, this spell is accompanied by spell 78 'for being transformed into a hawk'
