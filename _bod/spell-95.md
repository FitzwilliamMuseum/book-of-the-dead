Vignette from Spell 95 of the Book of the Dead of Ramose

Spell 95 is &lsquo;for being in the presence of Thoth&rsquo;, The vignette (small picture) shows Ramose bowing slightly forward and raising his arms in worship before an ibis-headed god, who is sitting on a white, shrine-shaped plinth. The god in question is [Thoth]().

He has a symbol of the moon, both as a crescent and as the full moon, on his head. The figure of Ramose is very well painted; as well his eye being outlined in black and a tiny black beard, the folds in his neck are also shown in thin black lines, indicating that his head is bowed forward.
