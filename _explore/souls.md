The ancient Egyptians believed that what we think of as a soul consisted of more than one concept, perhaps because they saw it as something too complex to be expressed simply by a single word. The most common types of soul were the _ka_ and the _ba_.

### Ka

The _ka_ was formed as a person’s double at the time he or she was created. It could lead one into adventures and scrapes (young people might be advised not to ‘follow the _ka_’, but to work hard). In a tomb, offerings were usually made for the _ka_ of the dead person, and the word _ka_ itself could be used to refer to food offerings.

The Egyptians also believed that a person’s _ka_ contained some aspects of personality inherited from his or her father.

### Ba

The _ba_ was represented as a bird with a person’s head and is often shown in the Book of the Dead as the part of the dead person which leaves the environment of the tomb.

For example, in spell 92 we see the ba flying out through the doorway of the tomb (depicted as a white doorframe round a black interior, with a pyramid on the top, all against the background of the desert hills shown in pink with red dots). The Egyptians believed that the _ba_ returned to the body every night in the afterlife.

### Shadow

The ancient Egyptians believed the shadow, which they called the _shut_ (pronounced ‘shoot’), to be another part of a person’s soul. There are very few pictures of the _shut_; where it does appear, it was represented as a black silhouette with an eye. Spell 92 (mentioned above) was said to be ‘for opening the tomb for the ba-spirit and the shadow so that they may go out in the day’. These two elements, the _ba_ and the _shut_, often appear in similar contexts in texts like the Book of the Dead.

The word _shut_ is written with a fan-shaped sunshade (seen in this detail from spell 92).

### Akh

The Egyptians used the term _akh_ to refer to a special type of spirit. This was the spiritual form a person took on by receiving the correct offerings and knowing the right spells. The word _akh_ means ‘effective’ or ‘an effective one’.
